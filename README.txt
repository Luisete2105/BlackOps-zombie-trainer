Plutonium:
Just extract the scripts on \AppData\Local\Plutonium\storage\t5\scripts\sp
and play, have fun.

Infinity Loader:
Copy the script of the map you are going to play (scripts are all the same, only
difference is if they have monkeys or not), create a new project on Bo1 ZM PC, delete
everything inside maing.gsc and paste mine, inject and enjoy.

IMPORTANT!:
1) I already know that testing zombie spawns dont always work, usually when they are a
"in_water", "in_snow" or "find_flesh" spawn type, also I havent tested it but I am pretty sure it
doesnt take into account dogs spawns, Astro spawns... etc, its not intedended to do that, I might add
them in the future but probably not, its expected behaviour.

2) Dual cz crashed me on Cosmodrome and Five but it worked on Moon, so I only skipped that weapon
on those 2 maps, I havent tested it on other maps so if someone does just tell me in which maps
is it crashing and I add those to te exception list.
