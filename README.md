# Plutonium:
Just extract the scripts on \AppData\Local\Plutonium\storage\t5\scripts
and play, have fun!.

# Infinity Loader:
Copy the script of the map you are going to play (scripts are all the same, only
difference is if they have monkeys or not, if you inject a monkey map script on
a no monkey map you will get an error), create a new project on Bo1 ZM PC, delete
everything inside maing.gsc and paste mine, inject and enjoy!.


# IMPORTANT!:
1) I already know that testing zombie spawns dont always work, usually when they are a
"in_water", "in_snow" or "find_flesh" spawn type(No, I will not add other zombie type spawns).

2) Dual cz crashes on some maps, I removed them on those maps but I have no idea if pap cz
also crashes so just in case I skipped them aswell.
